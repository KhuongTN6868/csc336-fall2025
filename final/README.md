## Deployed App
Check out the live version here: https://csc336-fall2025-rc8x.onrender.com


## What it is / What it does
Notes & Dogs is a simple full-stack web app I built as my final project for CSC336. The app lets you:

- View all saved notes on the **List** page
- Add new notes on the **Add Note** page
- Notes are saved persistently in a server-side JSON file
- Refresh the list to see newly added notes instantly

This project uses **React** for the front-end with React Router for navigation and **Express** for the back-end API. The app is styled with simple CSS to make it look clean and user-friendly. The goal was to practice full-stack development while keeping it fun and functional.

## External Libraries Used
- **React** — for building the front-end components  
- **React Router DOM** — for page routing  
- **Express** — to create the server and API
