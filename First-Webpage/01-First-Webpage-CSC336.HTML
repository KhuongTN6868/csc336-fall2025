    <h2 style="color: darkgreen;">I will talk a little bit about VietNam! </h2>
    <p>My name is <b>Khuong</b>. This is my very first webpage for CSC-336.  
       I want to share a little bit about <i>Vietnam</i>, my home country.  
       Vietnam has two main regions: the <u>North</u> and the <u>South</u>, each with its own traditions, food, and culture.</p>

    <p><small>(Translation: Only know you're hungry after eating Meaning: To only understand the importance of something once you have experienced it yourself. Usage: This proverb is often used when someone has had a change of heart after experiencing something for themselves. "She didn't want to go to the party, but she changed her mind after she saw how much fun everyone was having." "After going to the party, she realized how much fun it was and wished she had gone sooner.)</small></p>"
